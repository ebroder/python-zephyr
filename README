===================
Installing PyZephyr
===================

To install PyZephyr, you will first need to install Cython_. It's always a good
idea to install Cython through your package manager, if possible.  If your
package manager doesn't have a package for Cython, or if you wish to install
Cython by hand anyway, you can do so by running::

  $ easy_install Cython

Once you've done that, to install PyZephyr globally, run::

  $ python setup.py install

If you want to build PyZephyr without installing it globally, you may
want to run::

  $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

which will build the C extensions in place next to their source,
allowing you to import the various modules, so long as your current
working directory is the root of the PyZephyr source tree.

Alternatively, PyZephyr has been packaged for Debian and Ubuntu. To
build the Debian package of the latest release, run::

  $ git checkout debian
  $ git buildpackage
  $ sudo debi

You will need the devscripts and git-buildpackage packages installed,
as well as this package's build dependencies (debhelper,
python-all-dev, python-central, python, cython, libzephyr-dev).
